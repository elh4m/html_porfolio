<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a solid foundation in software engineering from Azad University, my academic journey began,
   leading to a Bachelor's degree in 2020.
  This period was marked by a profound engagement with computer software engineering, 
  complemented by a practical internship at GrandGroups in Iran. During this time, 
  I contributed to UI design and GPS service integration for the FERZ android application,
   honing my skills in Android development and team collaboration. </p>

<p>Advancing into my Master's in Robotic Engineering at the University of Genova, Italy, 
  I delved into complex projects and thesis work that pushed the boundaries of robotic communication and navigation.
   My thesis focused on enhancing trust dynamics and decision-making among airborne vehicles using VSLAM techniques 
   and drone camera feeds for obstacle detection. This period was enriched by university projects that spanned from 
   utilizing ROS for mobile robot navigation to leveraging machine learning for fetal health prediction, demonstrating
    my proficiency in Python, C++, and collaborative technology platforms.

<p>Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I am a self-motivated individual with
   a keen interest in photography, painting, and nature exploration. My journey reflects
    a blend of technical proficiency, creative problem-solving, and an unwavering commitment
     to advancing in the field of robotic engineering. With strong organizational and interpersonal skills,
     s I thrive in diverse teams, aiming to contribute to innovative solutions that leverage technology for impactful results.</p>
